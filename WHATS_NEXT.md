# ðŸŽ¯ What's Next for LlamaTrip

You've successfully processed your first production payment! Here's your roadmap for making LlamaTrip production-ready and successful.

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Do This First (Today)

### 1. Set Up Webhooks (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Why:** Without webhooks, you won't know when payments fail or subscriptions are cancelled.

**Action:** Follow `WEBHOOKS_SETUP.md`
- [ ] Add webhook endpoint to your backend
- [ ] Register webhook in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Test webhook events
- [ ] Deploy updated backend

**Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Impact:** Critical for operations

---

### 2. Monitor Your First Customer
**Why:** Make sure everything works as expected.

**Action:**
- [ ] Check Stripe Dashboard daily
- [ ] Watch for the first monthly renewal (in 30 days)
- [ ] Verify payment succeeds
- [ ] Test cancellation flow

**Dashboard:** https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers

---

### 3. Set Up Email Notifications
**Why:** Customers expect receipts and payment confirmations.

**Options:**

**Option A: Use Stripe's Built-in Emails (Easiest)**
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails
2. Enable:
   - [ ] Successful payments
   - [ ] Failed payments
   - [ ] Upcoming invoice reminders
   - [ ] Subscription cancellations

**Option B: Custom Emails**
- Integrate SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES
- Send custom branded emails via webhooks

**Time:** 30 minutes (Option A) or 2-4 hours (Option B)

---

## ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT - Do This Week

### 4. Add Customer Portal
**Why:** Let customers manage their own subscriptions.

Stripe provides a hosted portal where customers can:
- Update payment methods
- Cancel subscriptions
- View invoices
- Update billing info

**Implementation:**

```javascript
// Add to server/index.js
app.post('/api/create-portal-session', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { customerId } = req.body;
    
    const session = await stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create({
      customer: customerId,
      return_url: `${process.env.VITE_APP_URL}`,
    });
    
    res.json({ url: session.url });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating portal session:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

**Frontend Button:**
```tsx
<Button onClick={async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/api/create-portal-session`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ customerId: 'cus_...' })
  });
  const { url } = await response.json();
  window.location.href = url;
}}>
  Manage Subscription
</Button>
```

**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Impact:** Reduces support burden significantly

---

### 5. Add Database for Customer Management
**Why:** Track who has access to what.

**Recommended Setup:**
- Use Render's PostgreSQL
- Store: customer_id, subscription_id, status, email, created_at
- Update via webhooks

**Alternative:** Use Stripe's metadata feature to store user info

**Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Impact:** Essential for scaling

---

### 6. Implement Subscription Checks
**Why:** Only subscribers should access premium features.

**What to Add:**
- Middleware to verify active subscription
- Frontend checks to show/hide features
- Clear messaging for non-subscribers

See `WEBHOOKS_SETUP.md` Step 6 for implementation.

**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Impact:** Critical for monetization
